<h2>COVID-19 vaccine</h2>
<p>A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts in progress to develop such a vaccine. 
   In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months.[1] 
   By April 2020, some 50 vaccine candidates were in development, with four organizations having initiated Phase I safety studies in human subjects.</p>
